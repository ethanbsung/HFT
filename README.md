## 📊 Risk Management Framework

### Pre-Trade Risk Controls
- **Position Limits**: Dynamic position sizing based on market volatility
- **Concentration Risk**: Order size validation against typical market volume
- **Latency Checks**: Reject orders if system latency exceeds thresholds
- **PnL Limits**: Daily loss limits with graduated risk responses

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Emergency Stop Logic**: Automatic trading halt on critical risk breaches
- **Drawdown Tracking**: Real-time maximum drawdown calculation
- **Position Skewing**: Inventory-aware price adjustments to manage risk
- **Rate Limiting**: Order submission frequency controls

### Risk Metrics Dashboard
```
🛡️  RISK STATUS:
   Position Utilization: 65.2% of limit
   Daily PnL: -$125.50 (12.5% of limit)
   Max Drawdown: 2.3% (46% of limit)
   Order Rate: 23/sec (46% of limit)
   Risk Grade: A (92/100)
```

## ⚡ Performance & Latency

### Latency Benchmarks
| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|---------|----------|

## 🎯 Trading Strategy

### Market Making Logic
1. **Two-Sided Quoting**: Simultaneous bid/ask placement near best prices
2. **Inventory Management**: Position-aware price skewing to maintain target inventory
3. **Spread Capture**: Profit from bid-ask spread while providing liquidity
4. **Risk-Adjusted Pricing**: Dynamic spread widening based on market conditions

### Order Management
- **Queue Priority Optimization**: Strategic order placement for fill probability
- **Order Amendment**: Maintain queue position when possible vs. cancel-replace
- **Adaptive Timeouts**: Dynamic order TTL based on market volatility
- **Smart Cancellation**: Automatic order management during adverse conditions
